# Retrospection of Iteration 2

## Group Feedback and Actions

### Group Positives
- Communicated well
- We had less issues with merging  
- We finished what was required
- Meetings were more productive

### Group Areas of Improvement
- Not all the planned features were worked on 
- Imbalance in group contributions
- Progress was slow 
- Things were left to last minute


### Group Solutions
- Set more frequent personal and group deadlines 
- Try not to leave things to the last minute
- Try doing code reviews during our weekly meetings to encourage progress to be made and to check that the progress is following the plan for the features
- Follow the plan and break it down into more doable tasks

## Project Reflections
The changes we made for iteration 2 seemed to work well for us. Having the development branch to merge all our progress to made merging easier and was more forgiving then merging to main and releasing from the files in main. Paired programming was good for having someone to ask questions that is familiar with the task at hand. However, this was a bit counter-productive when the members were working synchronously on the same branch. Regardless, we will continue with the same pairs for iteration 3. 

For iteration 3 our main proirity is to have our source vendors feature finished to allow our concept to be more clearly applied. Since we pushed multiple features to iteration 3. We are pushing the lower priority features to future milestones.
