# Retrospection of Iteration 0 

## Group Feedback and Actions

### Group Positives
- We communicate well
- We consistently have meetings 
- We can make compromises for the group 
- We have good ideas for the project
- We are all nice to each other 
- We all want the project to go well and succeed in getting a good grade

### Group Areas of Improvement
- Reducing the length of our meetings
- Learn each others working styles

### Group Solutions
- To reduce the length of our meetings, we will come up with an agenda for the meeting beforehand. Group members will come to the meeting with their input that is prepared beforehand. 
- We agreed to assign dev tasks as we are available in the order of priority so that tasks that depend on other tasks will be completed/in progress already. 
- We will do daily check-ins on the Discord server to maintain good communication, update the team where we are on our tasks, and help each other with problems we encounter. 

## Project Reflections
- The first iteration involved the group brainstorming app ideas, discussing the architecture of the UI, logic and data layers, and ideating the layout of the app. 
- At first, there was some confusion of the functionality of certain features, and these things were clarified in a meeting to get us all on the same page. 
- We divided the work into 2 and came together to review the deliverables.
