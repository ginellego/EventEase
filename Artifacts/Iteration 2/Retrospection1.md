# Retrospection of Iteration 1

## Group Feedback and Actions

### Group Positives
- Communicated well
- Everyone was helpful 
- We finished what was required
- Supportive

### Group Areas of Improvement
- Github workflow was not sustained
- Ask for help when you need it 
- Assigning tasks vs taking them as we are available 


### Group Solutions
- Be sure to pull frequently
- Break down tasks into smaller tasks
- Use Instrumented UI Tests in Android Studio for testing code
- Try pair programming for each user story instead of picking tasks as you're available
- Change to a git workflow and create a "develop" branch to regularly push to

## Project Reflections
We decided to take the long route and spend time learning about dependency injection and using Dagger and Hilt right away so we wouldn’t have to modify anything later. Since this took more time to learn than we anticipated, we didn’t complete as much in iteration 1 than we planned for and ended up pushing our Vendor feature to iteration 2. 

We learned that using the GitHub workflow wouldn’t work for us as we needed to have access to each other's progress to connect other features. We adapted to this by adjusting our branching strategy for the remainder of iteration 1 by rebasing off the most recent/updated branch. To accommodate this in iteration 2, we will add a “develop” branch which we will branch from to work on features and regularly push to and pull from to stay current with each other. So, we will switch from a Github workflow to a gitflow workflow. 

To more effectively complete features, we will try pair programming for iteration 2. Partners will work on the same feature but complete the dev tasks independently. We can look to our partner for help and they will have a good idea of the situation because we will be working on the same feature.
