# Event Ease

An event planning app that will assist anyone in organizing an event.

This project was originally a project for the COMP 3350 course at the University of Manitoba. It has since been modified with my personal changes. 

## Purpose

Event Ease offers a platform to coordinate multiple events and track inquiries with vendors. It's intended to consolidate aspects of planning such as keeping a record of all in-progress event planning, looking for vendors for the events, and corresponding with vendors in the app. It aims to ease the process of planning and simplify the search for available vendors. 

## How to run the app

To run the app, you have a couple of options:

Download the APK: You can download the APK file from our release tag on our repository. Once downloaded, you can install it on your Android device.

Using Android Studio:

Ensure you have Android Studio installed on your machine.
Clone or download the project from our repository.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Connect your Android device to your computer.
Build the project and run the app configuration on your connected device.

For running tests:
